# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Please open an issue if you are unsure about
a contribution so we can discuss the overall implementation and design.

When you submit a pull request, a build is executed and unit tests are run.  Please build your
contribution and run the unit tests prior to submitting your pull request.  This will make it
easier to review.
